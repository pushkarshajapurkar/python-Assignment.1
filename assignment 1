Ans.1 = python is an interpreted, high level and general purpose programming language. 
 because it is easy to learn or easy to understand. It is interpreted some other languages 
 As we know python develop in C language and which will support anything like window 
 or linux that is gauranted by the developer. you can build webapps, write machine learning
 algorithms, embedded system and a lot of things . 

Ans.2 = In python, there is no need to define the types of variables. It allows to directly
 use the variables as its type-checking will be done during the execution of the program. 
 The interpreter checks the program line-by-line and also examines the data type of the variable. 

Ans.3 = pros                              
 1.It is easy to learn and easy to code
 2.Python is a very readable language because of its syntax.
 3.Python supports procedure-oriented programming and object oriented programming. Programs built 
   around object the merges data and functionality in object-oriented programming
 4.Python requires very less coding when compared to other programming languages to complete a
   simple task
 5.We can embed Python within C/C++ programs to give 'scripting' capabilities for program's users.

 Cons. 
 1. Python execution results are a bit slow as the code executed line by line.
 2. Python is not suitable to use under the limited memory restrictions. Python 
    structures need more memory space.
 3. Database layers are less comparative when compared with standard database layers
     ODBC and JDBC.
 4. Python is not so strong with mobile computing
 5. Python is not easy to test

Ans.4 = python is used for different domains such as Artificial Intelligence, machine learning,
 Data scientist, Data Analyst , developing websites and software, task Automation, web server 
 side development but It is not considered ideal for mobile app development and game development 
 due to the consumption of more memory and its slow processing speed while compared to other
 programming languages.

Ans.5 = In python there is no command or no need to decalre a variable. Variables is only a name
  given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory location.
 we declare only the assign value we put into the variable like (int, str, float) and after we
 check which type of data we assign in variable using "type" function. 

Ans. 6 = In python we take input like this. 
first = input("enter your name")
age = input("enter your age")
print("your name is:", first)
print("your age is:",(age))

Ans. 7 = The default data type of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function
  is "string". By default, input returns a string. So the name and age will be stored as strings. 

Ans.8 = In python type casting means that when we convert one data type to another data type like
 int to float, float to int etc 
 for example =
a = int("10")
b = float("10.0")
casted_a = float(a)
casted_b = int(b)
print(casted_a)
print(casted_b)

Ans.9 = 
Fname, Lname, age = input("enter your Fname, Lname, age:").split(",")
print("username:", Fname,Lname,age)

Ans.10 = Keywords are some predefined and reserved words in python that have special meanings.
 Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as an
 identifier, function, and variable name. All the keywords in python are written in lower case 
 except True and False.

Ans.11 = Keywords are used to define the syntax of the coding. The keyword cannot be used as 
 an identifier, function, and variable name . keyword is the part of syntax in programming that
 have special meaning to the compiler so thats the reason we cannot use the keyword as a variable
 if we use a keyword as a variable our code will not run ,code will show an error. 

Ans.12 = Indentation refers to the spaces and tabs at the start of a code line. In python always
 give you an error and your code will not get run if you skip the identation
 for example:=

institute = input("enter your institute:")
if institute == 'ineuron':
    print('Logging in !!')
else:
    print('invalid institute.')

print('All done!')

Ans.13 = In Python, we use the print() function to output data to the screen. Sometimes we might 
 want to take the input from the user. We can do by using the input() function.

 Ans.14 = there are many type of operator in python like Arthematic operator, logical operator,
 comparison operator etc they are used to perform values and variables. 

 Ans.15 = In Python programming, we can use division in two ways. The first one is Float Division
 ("/") like value in decimal form and the second is Integer Division("//") value in normal digit. 

Ans.16 = 
name = ("ineuron")
print(name * 5)

Ans.17 = 
number = int(input("enter your number "))

if (number % 2) == 0:
    print("the number is even")

else:
    print("the number is odd")    

Ans.18 = The logical operators and, or and not are also referred to as boolean operators. While 
 and as well as or operator needs two operands, which may evaluate to true or false, not operator
 needs one operand evaluating to true or false.
Boolean and operator returns true if both operands return true.
Boolean or operator returns true if any one operand is true
The not operator returns true if its operand is a false expression and returns false if it is true.

Ans.19 = 
FALSE
TRUE
FALSE
TRUE

Ans.20 = A conditional statement is that the name suggests itself, is used to handle conditions in 
 your program. These statements guide the program while making decisions based on the conditions 
 encountered by the program.
 python has 3 conditional statement (If , else, elif)

Ans.21 = if statement
If the condition following the keyword if evaluates as true, the block of code will execute. 
 Note that parentheses are not used before and after the condition check as in other languages.
else statement
You can optionally add an else response that will execute if the condition is false
elif statement
Multiple conditions can be checked by including one or more elif checks after your initial if 
 statement. 

Ans.22 = 
age = int(input("enter your age:"))
if age >=18:
        print("i can vote")

else:
    print("you are a child")   

Ans.23 = 
l=[12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
sum=0
for i in l:
    if i%2==0:
        sum+=i
print(sum)

Ans.24 = 
a = int(input("enter your first no.:"))
b = int(input("enter your second no.:"))
c = int(input("enter your third no.:"))

if (a>=b) and (a>=c):
    print(a)

elif (b>=a) and (b>=c):
    print(b)   

else:
    print(c)


Ans.25 = 
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
for i in numbers:
    if i > 500:
        break
    elif i > 150:
        continue
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print(i)
